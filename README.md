## 📝 Instruction Manual for Conduct

If you wish to replicate or review the experiment procedure, follow these steps:

### 1. Pre-Task Comprehension (Phase I)
* **Objective:** To establish a baseline of the participant’s
mental model regarding code logic and state track-
ing before the debugging intervention.
* **Material:** Participants are shown Snippet 1 (UserAc-
count), which involves state changes across multiple
functions**.
* **Instructions:** Answer the questions based strictly on reading the code. **Do not run the code.**

### 2. The Debugging Task (Phase II)
Participants are assigned to one of two conditions. 
* **Objective:** To observe debugging behavior and
search strategies.
* **Material:** Participants are shown Snippet 2 (Calculate Price).

* **Group A (Control):**
    * Debugs **Snippet 2 (Calculate Price)** using standard practices.
    * *Instruction:* "Proceed to debug the code. Once verified, submit your solution."

* **Group B (Treatment):**
    * Debugs **Snippet 2 (Calculate Price)** with forced articulation.
    * *Instruction:* "Before editing code, write down your hypothesis. Update this hypothesis before every subsequent attempt."

### 3. Post-Task Evaluation (Phase IV)
* **Objective:** To measure if the act of debugging (with
or without articulation) improved the clarity of the
developer’s mental model.
* **Material:** Questionnaire regarding the now-fixed Snippet 2.
* **Instructions:** Answer questions regarding the logic of the original buggy code to demonstrate understanding of the root cause.
